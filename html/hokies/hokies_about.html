<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>Hokies@Home: Documenting COVID-19 at Virginia Tech was created in the Spring of 2020 to collect official content from
Virginia Tech related to the COVID-19 global pandemic and to create a way for people who are part of the Virginia Tech
community to preserve their experiences during the pandemic as part of a publicly accessible collection. Special
Collections and University Archives coordinated with multiple departments within the University Libraries to identify
and actively preserve university communications about the pandemic and to solicit submissions from the community.</p>
<h2>What we collect</h2>
<p>Hokies@Home is an ongoing collection. We collect university announcements, VT News articles, web content, and other
university publications related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. In addition, we collect submissions from members of the Virginia Tech community about their experiences during the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>
<h2>Share your experience</h2>
<p>In an effort to document the extraordinary experiences of members of the Hokie Nation during the COVID-19 global
pandemic, we invite the Virginia Tech Community to submit oral histories, audio recordings, written stories, diary and
journal entries, photographs, videos, art, and other documentation for inclusion in the collection. We want to hear from university employees (faculty, staff, wage), students (prospective, undergraduate, graduate, doctoral), alumni, parents and family of Virginia Tech students, university contractors, and members of local communities (cities and towns) connected to Virginia Tech campuses. We also want to hear from all Virginia Tech locations across Virginia and
internationally.</p>
<p>You can choose your preferred method for documenting your experience. Some options include writing in a journal,
recording voice memos, saving your social media posts, taking photos and/or videos, interviewing friends of family
members, or creating multimedia works. We invite you to submit multiple items and to submit more than once. Please
comply with stay-at-home orders while self-documenting.</p>
<h2>Submission process</h2>
<p>Please use <a href="http://bit.ly/HokiesatHomeDonation">this form</a> to submit your items. You will be asked to agree to terms granting Special Collections non-exclusive distribution and preservation rights. You will still retain copyright to your work and do not give up the right to submit the work to publishers or other repositories.</p>
<p>If you manage official communications for a Virginia Tech college, unit, department, faculty/staff organization, or
student organization and you want these communications to be included in the collection, please contact us to discuss
transferring these materials to the archives.
</p>
<p>Submissions will not be available to the public immediately. They will be made available on this site after they have
been processed by Special Collections and University Archives staff.</p>
