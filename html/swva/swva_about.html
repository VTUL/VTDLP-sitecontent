<p>This portal site is created and administered by the Digital Imaging team from Digital Imaging and Preservation Services (DI&amp;PS) to host cultural and historical heritage materials of Virginia Tech and the state of Virginia. Digitization projects within this scope have been ongoing since 2016, which also led to the creation of the DI&amp;PS team. </p>
<p><span>University Libraries at Virginia Tech</span> is currently building a new digital library infrastructure. This portal site is a temporary platform to host our growing digital collections and is also an ongoing project itself. In addition to this portal site, we have revised our <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="/get-involved">Selection Scope</a></span> policy, developed a <strong><a href="https://webapps.es.vt.edu/confluence/display/DIPS/Digital+Imaging+and+Preservation+Services+Home" target="blank" rel="noopener"> documentation wiki for DI&amp;PS <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/24/000000/external-link.png" alt width="15" height="15"></a></strong>, and created new workflows to address incoming content from our partners.
