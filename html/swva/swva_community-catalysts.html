<h2>Community Development Model for Digital Community Archives</h2>
<p>Community Development Model for Digital Community Archives is a model for community engagement that fosters robust partnerships among academic libraries and regional organizations, which will result in greater digital access to currently isolated collections and networks. Small regional institutions and organizations possess rich cultural heritage collections but often lack robust digital infrastructures. This project addresses these library and community needs through collaborative digital repatriation and collection development. The team will develop and pilot a participatory library development model. The work will expand digital access to previously isolated or rural collections while ensuring that the collections continue to reside with their owners.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The primary deliverables for this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A project plan for a Southwestern Virginia community archive</li>
<li>A replicable model for developing regional non-custodial digital archives</li>
</ul>
<p>This model will identify the sociotechnical resources libraries need to leverage in order to support smaller institutions in community archiving efforts, and to aggregate content with them.</p>
